# Blockchain and Internet: Addressing the Need for Auditability and Predictability

## Introduction

In this README, we explore the question: What features does the Internet, as we know it, lack that we need blockchains for? We emphasize the importance of auditability and predictability in this context.

### Lack of Developer Freedom

Current blockchain technology often falls short in respecting developers due to a significant limitation: they do not allow developers to migrate to another platform natively. This means that once a choice is made to build on a particular blockchain, developers are effectively locked into it for the entire lifespan of their application.

While successful migrations have been accomplished, the question arises: Can they be repeated? While it is possible to replicate the migration process, scalability becomes a concern. Moreover, when key features are missing on the host platform, developers are forced to resort to hacks, tricks, and ad-hoc solutions, consuming valuable engineering time. The solution lies in respecting developers' freedom.

## Developers' Perspective

We frequently refer to "developers" in this context. Developers represent a wide spectrum of individuals, including solo programmers, start-ups, and large corporations. Within the blockchain model, developers' collective performance is hindered because they are confined to choices made early in their application's development. This limitation extends to the available options for achieving verifiable "auditability" and "predictability."

Developers should have the freedom to explore the trade-off spectrum of "auditability" and "predictability" without artificial constraints.

## Tools for Improvement

Fortunately, there are tools in our technological toolbox that can enhance the Internet's "auditability" and "predictability" without compromising compatibility with existing infrastructure.

1. **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**: SSL enables secure communication using digital signatures, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of data transmission.

2. **MPC (Multi-Party Computation)**: MPC allows untrusted clients to verifiably prove communication among different servers, ensuring data security without relying on client trust.

## Verifiable Communication

Through the use of SSL and MPC, we can achieve verifiable communication without the need to trust clients explicitly.

Consider the following scenario:

1. The client collaborates with server A to generate a verifiably generated request.
2. This request, along with a validity proof, is then transmitted to server B.

## Trust Considerations

The need for trust becomes less crucial when these technologies are implemented effectively, ultimately enhancing the auditability and predictability of Internet-based systems.

By addressing these issues and providing developers with greater flexibility, we can pave the way for a more robust and efficient Internet infrastructure that caters to the diverse needs of developers and users alike.
